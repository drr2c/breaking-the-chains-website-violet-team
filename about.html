        <p>According to borgenproject.org, over 53,000 Brazilians were rescued from forced labor between 1995 and 2017, and 35,000 people were rescued from slave labor between 2003 and 2017.</p>

        <p>The Global Slavery Index of 2023 stated approximately 1,053,000 of Brazil's population was living in modern slavery. This is more than half of their total population.</p>

        <p>The majority of men that are trafficked in Brazil are forced into slave labor, while the majority of women are sexually exploited, according to unodc.org.</p>

        <p>Theexodusroad.com states the major trafficking types in Brazil are sexual exploitation and forced labor. The main tourist areas in Brazil are where a large amount of the children sexual exploitations occur. 77,290 cases of children exploitation were reported in 2016 alone. Spanish speaking people in Brazil are at a higher risk of being trafficked due to the language barrier with police mainly speaking Portuguese. This source also reports approximately 250,000 to 400,000 children were trafficked in 2009 and reported to the Brazilian Federal Police. The Brazilian areas impacted the most by trafficking are Goias, Minas Gerias, Pernambuco, Rio de Janeiro, and Sao Paulo.</p>

        <p>Law 13.344 was enacted in 2016 for a greater level of accountability for traffickers and assistance to victims. The law can only do so much, however, when evidence is not found or turned in. (https://www.gov.br/mj/pt-br/acesso-a-informacao/atuacao-internacional/legislacao-traduzida/lei_n_13-344_de_6_de_outubro_de_2016_eng-docx.pdf)</p>

        <p><strong>Organizations such as The Exodus Road, Project Rescue, Institute Elo, and ASBRAD are working to end human trafficking in Brazil, but more help is needed.</strong></p>

        <p>Brazil remains on Tier 2 status, meaning its government has made efforts to end human trafficking but the problem is still prevalent. (https://www.state.gov/reports)</p>
