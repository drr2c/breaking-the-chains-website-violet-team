        <h3 id="storiesCard2Header">Woman Saved After Nearly 40 Years as an Enslaved Maid</h3>
        <p id="storiesCard2content1">For almost four decades, a 46-year-old Brazilian woman lived in near-total captivity, working as a domestic servant for the family of Dalton Cesar Milagres Rigueira in Patos de Minas, Minas Gerais. Given to the household by her destitute parents when she was just eight years old, she spent her life in a small room, performing unpaid labor with no time off. Over the years, the family forced her into marriage with an elderly relative so they could continue collecting his pension. Her plight only came to light when neighbors noticed notes she had left asking for food and hygiene products and alerted the authorities, leading labor inspectors to rescue her and bring her to a shelter where she began receiving care from psychologists and social workers.</p>
        <p id="storiesCard2content2">Now free, the woman is slowly adjusting to a life she never knew. She receives a monthly pension of about R$8,000 ($1,557) and is learning to use a credit card and manage her own finances for the first time. Labor prosecutors are negotiating compensation with the Rigueira family, while Dalton Rigueira faces potential criminal charges that could carry up to eight years in prison. After decades of servitude, the woman is finally beginning to experience independence, a life where she can make her own choices and reclaim the years that were stolen from her.</p>

        <p id="storiesCard3content1">Spartacus III, coordinated by INTERPOL’s Regional Bureau for South America, targeted human trafficking across the continent, with a major focus on Brazilian airports. Guarulhos Airport in São Paulo served as a key hub where police used INTERPOL’s global databases to identify potential traffickers and victims. Brazilian authorities, building on their Intercops training model, conducted workshops and practical exercises at airports to strengthen regional cooperation and law enforcement capabilities. These efforts helped Brazil observe trafficking trends, identify how networks use the country as an entry or exit point, and improve their ability to intervene effectively.</p>
        <p id="storiesCard3content2">In Brazil, the operation led to the closure of an adoption agency suspected of trafficking children and babies from Eastern Europe. The coordinated raids across airports and other transit points contributed to the dismantling of organized networks and the rescue of numerous victims. Overall, Brazilian authorities played a central role in the identification, monitoring, and arrest of traffickers, ensuring that victims were safely recovered and provided with support while gathering intelligence to dismantle networks operating in and through the country.</p>
        <p id="storiesCard3content3">The broader operation across 25 countries rescued more than 2,700 victims and resulted in 134 arrests, highlighting the critical role of Brazilian participation in regional anti-trafficking efforts. By combining specialized training, airport-focused operations, and collaboration with INTERPOL and other national police forces, Brazil strengthened its ability to protect victims and disrupt human trafficking networks, reinforcing the country’s position as a key player in South America’s fight against modern slavery.</p>

        <h3 id="storiesCard6Header">Brazilian Trafficking Victim Rescued After Connecting with a Previous Survivor</h3>
        <p id="storiesCard6content1">Bruna (pseudonym), a Brazilian woman, discovered a social media story from another Brazilian survivor, Phelipe, describing how he had been trafficked to a scamming compound in Myanmar and later rescued by The Exodus Road Brazil. His account resonated deeply with her because she had recently endured a similar experience. After pursuing what she believed was a legitimate job opportunity, Bruna found herself trapped in a Myanmar hotel, exploited through grueling work, poor treatment, and severe deprivation.</p>
        <p id="storiesCard6content2">Seeking a way out, Bruna reached out to The Exodus Road through social media, prompting an immediate response from the organization’s Brazil Country Director. Working with government officials and partner NGOs, the team devised a complex, month-long extraction plan. They managed to deceive the Chinese mafia controlling Bruna’s movements, navigating multiple vehicle switches and altered routes to avoid detection. The operation was further supported by state authorities and the NGO RESGATE, which funded her travel and repatriation.</p>
        <p id="storiesCard6content3">Upon Bruna’s return to Brazil, two traffickers involved in her exploitation were promptly arrested. Now safely home, she is able to focus on healing, reclaiming her dignity, and rebuilding after months of abuse. Her story demonstrates the power of connection and collaboration across borders, cultures, and sectors in combating human trafficking and supporting survivors.</p>

        <h3 id="storiesCard7Header">Transgender Women Help Fight Human Trafficking in Brazil</h3>
        <p id="storiesCard7content1">Valeria Rodrigues accompanies Brazilian police on raids to rescue transgender women from prostitution, bringing snacks for the victims. As a former sex worker and a transgender woman, she knows the exhaustion and hunger of the women they are about to rescue. Speaking Pajuba, the secret language of Brazil’s trans community, she reassures them: “I am with you, I am like you.” Her presence gives the victims courage to step away from the abusive pimps who have controlled their lives, showing them that help can be safe, familiar, and understanding.</p>
        <p id="storiesCard7content2">Rodrigues’ own life reflects the hardships she now helps others escape. Rejected by her family at sixteen, she survived on the streets before finding a path back into education and eventually founding Instituto Nice, a shelter and support network for rescued trans women. The charity doesn’t just provide a safe place to sleep—it helps women legally change their names, access healthcare, and learn skills that allow them to build independent lives. Each rescue operation brings women who are physically and emotionally worn, yet gradually able to reclaim their futures.</p>
        <p id="storiesCard7content3">The dangers are complex: traffickers lure women with promises of surgery, housing, or work, but these offers often lead to debt and forced labor. Some women, like Julia, found themselves trapped by expensive and unsafe procedures, forced to work for years to pay off impossible debts. Thanks to interventions led by Rodrigues and the authorities, women are now leaving those cages behind, slowly finding jobs, education, and medical care. While the road ahead is difficult, these small victories illuminate a path of hope, empowerment, and the possibility of a life beyond exploitation.</p>

As autoridades brasileiras, baseando-se em seu modelo de treinamento Intercops, realizaram oficinas e exercícios práticos nos aeroportos para fortalecer a cooperação regional e as capacidades das forças de segurança. Esses esforços ajudaram o Brasil a observar as tendências do tráfico, identificar como as redes utilizam o país como ponto de entrada ou saída e melhorar sua capacidade de intervir de maneira eficaz.",
    card3content2: "No Brasil, a operação levou ao fechamento de uma agência de adoção suspeita de traficar crianças e bebês da Europa Oriental. As buscas coordenadas em aeroportos e outros pontos de trânsito contribuíram para o desmantelamento de redes organizadas e o resgate de inúmeras vítimas. No geral, as autoridades brasileiras desempenharam um papel central na identificação, monitoramento e prisão dos traficantes, garantindo que as vítimas fossem recuperadas com segurança e recebendo apoio, ao mesmo tempo em que coletavam informações para desmantelar redes que operavam dentro e através do país.",
    card3content3: "A operação mais ampla em 25 países resgatou mais de 2.700 vítimas e resultou em 134 prisões, destacando o papel crucial da participação brasileira nos esforços regionais contra o tráfico. Ao combinar treinamento especializado, operações focadas em aeroportos e colaboração com a INTERPOL e outras forças policiais nacionais, o Brasil fortaleceu sua capacidade de proteger vítimas e desmantelar redes de tráfico de pessoas, reforçando a posição do país como um ator chave na luta da América do Sul contra a escravidão moderna.",

    card4Header: "Uma Oportunidade de Emprego que se Transformou em Escravidão em uma Fazenda de Mandioca",
    card4content: "Este vídeo, produzido pela Exodus Road, conta a história de Samuel. Com sete anos e vindo do Paraguai, Samuel viajou para o Brasil na esperança de sustentar sua família. Em vez disso, acabou escravizado em uma fazenda de mandioca. Samuel estava sobrecarregado, desprotegido e sofria abusos.",

    card5Header: "Entrevista com Sobreviventes de Extorsão em um Esquema de 'Pig Butchering'",
    card5content: "Em fevereiro de 2025, Phelipe e Luckas escaparam de uma situação angustiante em Mianmar, onde foram atraídos e extorquidos em um esquema de abate de porcos comandado por uma grande máfia criminosa. Hoje, eles estão livres e seguindo em frente em sua jornada como sobreviventes de volta ao Brasil.",

    card6Header: "Vítima de Tráfico Brasileira Resgatada Após se Conectar com uma Sobrevivente Anterior",
    card6content1: "Bruna (pseudônimo), uma mulher brasileira, descobriu uma história nas redes sociais de outro sobrevivente brasileiro, Phelipe, descrevendo como ele havia sido traficado para um complexo de golpes em Mianmar e depois resgatado pela The Exodus Road Brazil. Seu relato ressoou profundamente nela porque ela havia passado recentemente por uma experiência semelhante. Depois de buscar o que acreditava ser uma oportunidade de trabalho legítima, Bruna se viu presa em um hotel em Mianmar, explorada por trabalhos exaustivos, mau tratamento e severa privação.",
    card6content2: "Procurando uma saída, Bruna entrou em contato com a The Exodus Road através das redes sociais, o que provocou uma resposta imediata do Diretor Nacional da organização no Brasil. Trabalhando com autoridades governamentais e ONGs parceiras, a equipe elaborou um plano de extração complexo, com duração de um mês. Eles conseguiram enganar a máfia chinesa que controlava os movimentos de Bruna, realizando múltiplas trocas de veículos e rotas alteradas para evitar a detecção. A operação contou ainda com o apoio das autoridades estaduais e da ONG RESGATE, que financiou sua viagem e repatriação.",
    card6content3: "Após o retorno de Bruna ao Brasil, dois traficantes envolvidos em sua exploração foram prontamente presos. Agora segura em casa, ela consegue se concentrar na sua recuperação, na retomada da dignidade e na reconstrução após meses de abuso. Sua história demonstra o poder da conexão e da colaboração entre fronteiras, culturas e setores no combate ao tráfico de pessoas e no apoio às vítimas.",

    card7Header: "Mulheres Trans Ajudam a Combater o Tráfico Humano no Brasil",
    card7content1: "Valeria Rodrigues acompanha a polícia brasileira em operações para resgatar mulheres trans da prostituição, levando lanches para as vítimas. Como ex-trabalhadora sexual e mulher trans, ela conhece o cansaço e a fome das mulheres que estão prestes a resgatar. Falando Pajubá, a linguagem secreta da comunidade trans do Brasil, ela as tranquiliza: “Estou com vocês, sou como vocês.” Sua presença dá coragem às vítimas para se afastarem dos cafetões abusivos que controlaram suas vidas, mostrando que a ajuda pode ser segura, familiar e compreensiva.",
    card7content2: "A própria vida de Rodrigues reflete as dificuldades das quais ela agora ajuda outras pessoas a escapar. Rejeitada por sua família aos dezesseis anos, ela sobreviveu nas ruas antes de encontrar um caminho de volta à educação e, eventualmente, fundar o Instituto Nice, um abrigo e uma rede de apoio para mulheres trans resgatadas. A instituição de caridade não oferece apenas um lugar seguro para dormir—ela ajuda as mulheres a mudarem legalmente seus nomes, acessarem cuidados de saúde e aprenderem habilidades que lhes permitem construir vidas independentes. Cada operação de resgate traz mulheres que estão física e emocionalmente desgastadas, mas que gradualmente conseguem recuperar seus futuros.",
    card7content3: "Os perigos são complexos: traficantes atraem mulheres com promessas de cirurgia, moradia ou trabalho, mas essas ofertas muitas vezes levam a dívidas e trabalho forçado. Algumas mulheres, como Julia, se viram presas em procedimentos caros e perigosos, sendo forçadas a trabalhar por anos para pagar dívidas impossíveis. Graças a intervenções lideradas por Rodrigues e pelas autoridades, as mulheres agora estão deixando essas armadilhas para trás, encontrando lentamente empregos, educação e cuidados médicos. Embora o caminho à frente seja difícil, essas pequenas vitórias iluminam um caminho de esperança, empoderamento e a possibilidade de uma vida além da exploração.",

    card8Header: "Uma Investigadora Aposentada de uma Força-Tarefa Contra a Escravidão Compartilha Sua História e Incentiva a Próxima Geração",
    card8content: "Este vídeo faz parte de uma série da Thomson Reuters Foundation. Ele conta a história de Valderez Monte, uma investigadora. Ela teve um papel importante no resgate de centenas de pessoas presas em trabalho forçado. Ela também compartilhou o impacto emocional que esse trabalho tem sobre ela, descrevendo como as histórias das vítimas ficam com ela."
