        <h3 id="storiesCard2Header">Woman Saved After Nearly 40 Years as an Enslaved Maid</h3>
        <p id="storiesCard2content1">For almost four decades, a 46-year-old Brazilian woman lived in near-total captivity, working as a domestic servant for the family of Dalton Cesar Milagres Rigueira in Patos de Minas, Minas Gerais. Given to the household by her destitute parents when she was just eight years old, she spent her life in a small room, performing unpaid labor with no time off. Over the years, the family forced her into marriage with an elderly relative so they could continue collecting his pension. Her plight only came to light when neighbors noticed notes she had left asking for food and hygiene products and alerted the authorities, leading labor inspectors to rescue her and bring her to a shelter where she began receiving care from psychologists and social workers.</p>
        <p id="storiesCard2content2">Now free, the woman is slowly adjusting to a life she never knew. She receives a monthly pension of about R$8,000 ($1,557) and is learning to use a credit card and manage her own finances for the first time. Labor prosecutors are negotiating compensation with the Rigueira family, while Dalton Rigueira faces potential criminal charges that could carry up to eight years in prison. After decades of servitude, the woman is finally beginning to experience independence, a life where she can make her own choices and reclaim the years that were stolen from her.</p>

        <h3 id="storiesCard3Header">More Than 2,700 Human Trafficking Victims Rescued in INTERPOL-Coordinated Operation</h3>
        <p id="storiesCard3content1">Spartacus III, coordinated by INTERPOL’s Regional Bureau for South America, targeted human trafficking across the continent, with a major focus on Brazilian airports. Guarulhos Airport in São Paulo served as a key hub where police used INTERPOL’s global databases to identify potential traffickers and victims. Brazilian authorities, building on their Intercops training model, conducted workshops and practical exercises at airports to strengthen regional cooperation and law enforcement capabilities. These efforts helped Brazil observe trafficking trends, identify how networks use the country as an entry or exit point, and improve their ability to intervene effectively.</p>
        <p id="storiesCard3content2">In Brazil, the operation led to the closure of an adoption agency suspected of trafficking children and babies from Eastern Europe. The coordinated raids across airports and other transit points contributed to the dismantling of organized networks and the rescue of numerous victims. Overall, Brazilian authorities played a central role in the identification, monitoring, and arrest of traffickers, ensuring that victims were safely recovered and provided with support while gathering intelligence to dismantle networks operating in and through the country.</p>
        <p id="storiesCard3content3">The broader operation across 25 countries rescued more than 2,700 victims and resulted in 134 arrests, highlighting the critical role of Brazilian participation in regional anti-trafficking efforts. By combining specialized training, airport-focused operations, and collaboration with INTERPOL and other national police forces, Brazil strengthened its ability to protect victims and disrupt human trafficking networks, reinforcing the country’s position as a key player in South America’s fight against modern slavery.</p>

        <p id="storiesCard5content">In February of 2025, Phelipe and Luckas escaped a harrowing situation in Myanmar where they were lured and extorted in a pig butchering scheme ran by a large scale criminal mafia enterprise. Today, they are free and moving forward in their journey as survivors back home in Brazil.</p>

        <h3 id="storiesCard6Header">Brazilian Trafficking Victim Rescued After Connecting with a Previous Survivor</h3>
        <p id="storiesCard6content1">Bruna (pseudonym), a Brazilian woman, discovered a social media story from another Brazilian survivor, Phelipe, describing how he had been trafficked to a scamming compound in Myanmar and later rescued by The Exodus Road Brazil. His account resonated deeply with her because she had recently endured a similar experience. After pursuing what she believed was a legitimate job opportunity, Bruna found herself trapped in a Myanmar hotel, exploited through grueling work, poor treatment, and severe deprivation.</p>
        <p id="storiesCard6content2">Seeking a way out, Bruna reached out to The Exodus Road through social media, prompting an immediate response from the organization’s Brazil Country Director. Working with government officials and partner NGOs, the team devised a complex, month-long extraction plan. They managed to deceive the Chinese mafia controlling Bruna’s movements, navigating multiple vehicle switches and altered routes to avoid detection. The operation was further supported by state authorities and the NGO RESGATE, which funded her travel and repatriation.</p>
        <p id="storiesCard6content3">Upon Bruna’s return to Brazil, two traffickers involved in her exploitation were promptly arrested. Now safely home, she is able to focus on healing, reclaiming her dignity, and rebuilding after months of abuse. Her story demonstrates the power of connection and collaboration across borders, cultures, and sectors in combating human trafficking and supporting survivors.</p>

        <h3 id="storiesCard7Header">Transgender Women Help Fight Human Trafficking in Brazil</h3>
        <p id="storiesCard7content1">Valeria Rodrigues accompanies Brazilian police on raids to rescue transgender women from prostitution, bringing snacks for the victims. As a former sex worker and a transgender woman, she knows the exhaustion and hunger of the women they are about to rescue. Speaking Pajuba, the secret language of Brazil’s trans community, she reassures them: “I am with you, I am like you.” Her presence gives the victims courage to step away from the abusive pimps who have controlled their lives, showing them that help can be safe, familiar, and understanding.</p>
        <p id="storiesCard7content2">Rodrigues’ own life reflects the hardships she now helps others escape. Rejected by her family at sixteen, she survived on the streets before finding a path back into education and eventually founding Instituto Nice, a shelter and support network for rescued trans women. The charity doesn’t just provide a safe place to sleep—it helps women legally change their names, access healthcare, and learn skills that allow them to build independent lives. Each rescue operation brings women who are physically and emotionally worn, yet gradually able to reclaim their futures.</p>
        <p id="storiesCard7content3">The dangers are complex: traffickers lure women with promises of surgery, housing, or work, but these offers often lead to debt and forced labor. Some women, like Julia, found themselves trapped by expensive and unsafe procedures, forced to work for years to pay off impossible debts. Thanks to interventions led by Rodrigues and the authorities, women are now leaving those cages behind, slowly finding jobs, education, and medical care. While the road ahead is difficult, these small victories illuminate a path of hope, empowerment, and the possibility of a life beyond exploitation.</p>
